# Stock Market Analysis Using Python

## Introduction
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of historical stock prices using Python. The aim was to analyze trends, calculate key financial metrics, and derive actionable insights to assist in investment decisions. The project utilized various Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, for data manipulation and visualization.

## Objectives
- To analyze historical stock data and visualize price trends.
- To calculate moving averages and other financial metrics.
- To develop insights that could assist in making informed investment decisions.

## Methodology
### Data Acquisition
Historical stock price data was obtained using the `yfinance` library, which allows for easy access to financial data from Yahoo Finance. For this project, I chose Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the target stock, downloading data from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2023.

### Data Analysis
1. **Data Preparation**: The downloaded data was prepared for analysis by cleaning and formatting it appropriately. This included handling missing values and ensuring the date format was consistent.
   
2. **Calculating Moving Averages**: 
   - The 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) were calculated to identify short-term and long-term trends in the stock price.
   - Moving averages serve as useful indicators for determining potential buy or sell signals.

### Data Visualization
To visualize the stock price trends and moving averages, I utilized Matplotlib to create a line graph. The visualization included:
- Closing prices over time.
- The 20-day and 50-day moving averages to highlight trends.

## Results
The analysis yielded the following insights:
- The plotted graph showed the historical price fluctuations of AAPL over the specified period.
- The moving averages indicated periods of bullish and bearish trends, which could be used as a basis for trading decisions.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the application of Python in financial data analysis. By utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I was able to perform a detailed analysis of historical stock prices. The results highlight the importance of technical indicators, such as moving averages, in making informed investment decisions.

## Future Work
Future iterations of this project could include:
- Incorporating more complex indicators such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) or Bollinger Bands.
- Expanding the analysis to include multiple stocks for comparative analysis.
- Implementing machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
